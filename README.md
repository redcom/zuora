========

[zuora](https://github.com/DeadAlready/node-zuora) is a wrapper that allows easy operations through the Zuora REST API.
It uses the restify client to make requests and an internal validator to do basic validation beforehand.
It also parses the errors coming from zuora to provide a readable format if possible.

# Installation

    $ npm install zuora

# Usage

zuora exports the create method for creating a new zuora object

    var zuora = require('zuora');
    var client = zuora.create(config);

## Configuration

The following options are available:

+ user:(required)  *The user used to authenticate with zuora
+ password:(required) *The password for zuora user
+ log: *Bunyan logger
+ catalogTTL: *Time to live for the internal catalog cache
+ validation: *Options for the validation
+ url: *The zuora endpoint url
+ production: *If url is not provided then this flag will determine whether api or apisandbox-api.zuora.com will be used
